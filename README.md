# Space-Station-Website
Simple mock space tour company website I created using HTML and CSS.

One of the first coding projects I ever worked on. This is just a simple mock website I created using vanilla HTML and CSS. My goal was to create a webpage with the basics that I knew at the time that would look cool and different than other boring designs I had been learning. It contains several sections, a photo gallery and a reservations forum, as well as a heading section upon landing on the page.
